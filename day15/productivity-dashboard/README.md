# Productivity Dashboard (React + Vite)

Minimal starter implementing:
- PWA (manifest.json + service-worker.js)
- Theme & User Context via React Context API
- Redux Toolkit store example
- Service worker registration + offline caching
- Install prompt support

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- This is a lightweight example. For production PWA features consider using vite-plugin-pwa or Workbox.
